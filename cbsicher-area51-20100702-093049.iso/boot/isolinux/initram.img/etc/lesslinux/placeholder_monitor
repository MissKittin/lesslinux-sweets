Screen initialization failed

If this message does not disappear in the next seconds the startup of the
graphical user interface failed. The most likely reasons for this are either
wrong manual settings or a new and unsupported chipset. You may force use
of the VESA driver. Please try the following:

 * If the testscreen appears, confirm that the settings match perfectly. You
   may alter the resolution afterwards when the desktop is fully loaded.
   
 * If no testscreen (and no configuration tool) appears, you might force 
   usage of the VESA driver with the boot menu. Please read the supplied 
   documentation on the topic "safe startup".
   
You can help enhancing LessLinux by providing information on your hardware to
hardware@lesslinux.org. Please also provide the build ID and the settings that
may have lead to a usable startup.
