SpeedTouch Configuration for Alcatel USB Modem
Tested on RedHat 8.0 with BT OpenWorld by Steve
Tested on Mandrake 9.0 with BT OpenWorld by Steve
Updated 29 Oct 2002 to create a log file for diagnosis.
Updated 21 Nov 2002 to list Singapore Pacificnet VPI/VCI pair.
Updated 25 Nov 2002 to use "tar -xzf" not "tar xzf" as one user reported problems.
Also added a web page (http://www.japarker.btinternet.co.uk/speedtouch/)
Updated 03 Dec 2002 - moved to http://speedtouchconf.sourceforge.net/
btinternet.co.uk site deprecated.
Updated 05 Dec 2002 - creates symlink to /etc/ppp/resolv.conf to fix DNS problems.
Also includes speedtouch-1.1.tar.bz2, accepts microcode in current directory as
speedmgmt.tar.gz, mgmt.o, or alcaudsl.sys. Therefore no need to edit the script.
Updated 07 Dec 2002 - fixed a bug that it couldn't find the tarball.
Updated 17 Dec 2002 - added uname -a to logfile, added tests for gcc, make
Updated 23 Dec 2002 - specified GPLv2 after reading http://www.infoworld.com/articles/hn/xml/02/11/06/021106hngnudelay.xml?s=IDGNS
Version 08 Jan 2003 missing a "fi" - fixed 15/1/2003
16 Jan 2003 - fixed another stupid bug.
19 Jan 2003 - Actually did some decent testing, and got it working again. Also added a comment about the timeout messages.
20 Jan 2003 - Just some extra checks.
23 Feb 2003 - Allows for init.d being /etc/init.d/ or /etc/rc.d/init.d
Also some basic checks for the kernel-level driver. First tidy-up of the kernel testing code, too.
07 Mar 2003 - Some SuSE (LSB) tidyups; skip debian-specific notes for non-debian users
11th August 2003 - Changed to stop if gcc/make/etc are not installed. Also bundled the 1.2beta2 driver.
18th August 2003 - Tidied up the output a little bit to make it clearer.
9th September 2003 - Fixed speedtouch-init for RedHat 9
11th September 2003 - Added 2.6 support; tidied up the kernel checks a bit.
27th October 2003 - Changed 1.1 and 1.2-beta2 versions of modem_run to report different error codes for each error (instead of "-1==255" for everything). Hopefully this should assist debugging. All GPL-licensed, of course.
... missed a few updates ...
7th Dec 2003 - No longer checks for /etc/issue - it didn't work anyway and
not all distro's have it. Now checks for start-stop-deamon as that's what
matters. Removes defaultrouter if found; removes speedtch module if found.
21 Dec 2003 - Fixed for microcode already loaded (still may have problems with existing ppp processes). Fixed defaultrouter notices. 
28 Jan 2004 - Tidied up required binary checks, added SuSE9 support (pusb_linux.c needs replacing).
18,19 Feb 2004 - Attempts at Silver "400" modem support, dealing with SuSE9 stuff better
03 March 2004 - Replaced 1.2beta2 with 1.2beta3 which deals with SuSE9 and others mixing 2.4 kernel with 2.6 headers (!); re-patched for silver "400" modem. The Feb 04 releases which tried to do this with 1.2beta2 have been hidden from public view, as this version should be used instead.
04 March 2004 - Changed "-m 1" to "-m" in speedtouch-init to match new modem_run settings
15 March 2004 - Added "-e 1" to pppoa3 (moving towards Linux 2.6 support - still unsupported until tested). Extra checks for multi-line "pppd --version" output. Fixed 242/250 result codes becoming zero.
19 March 2004 - speedtouch-1.2 released, supports all current modems (including silver (rev 4) modem).
22 Apr 2004 - Added "240" note about silver modem firmware. Added link to speedtouchconf.sf.net copy of rev4fw.zip. Added "-o" option to unzip to force overwrite of any existing files. Added check for Mandrake before assuming no "lspci" means "lspcidrake" must exist.
22 May 2004 - Added reported VPI/VCI for Netherlands. Added support for "2.4.2b3" and similar pppd versions. Added i18n! Italian translation by Andrea Lusuardi
10 Jun 2004 - Added Polish (Neostrada) VPI/VCI. Added driver 1.3 from Debian package - Debian 2.6.5
has been reported to work, so hopefully this will help FC2, Mdk10 users too. Untested.
12 June 2004 - Added Italian translation thanks to Andrea.
19 June 2004 - Added Spanish translation (es.po) - thanks to Sebastian. Added checks for usbcore (FC2).
init script adds /usr/local/sbin to start of PATH (not end of PATH) so we know what we're getting.
03 Nov 2004 - Added some stuff to hopefully work better with Mandrake 10.
10 Nov 2004 - More updates
25 Jan 2005 - Portugese translation supplied by Jo√£o M. S. Silva
Removed the need for the "bc" package (Mandrake no longer install it by default)17 Feb 2005 - Fixes for usbdevfs, LOAD_USBINTERFACE. Thanks to Geoff Horn, John Gregory. Tested on whiteboxlinux.org (2.4) and FC3 (2.6) kernels.
18 Feb 2005 - Added usbdevfs fixes to speedtouch-init, and awareness of modprobe.local.conf. Defaults to /etc/init.d if /etc/SuSE-release found.
20 Feb 2005 - modprobe.local.conf from the 18/2/05 version should be modprobe.conf.local. Fixed PREFIX for modules. Check if /proc/bus/usb is mounted before trying to mount it.
21 Feb 2005 - fix for getbus() being called as get_usb().
23 Feb 2005 - fix the get_usb() function itself, and fix chkconfig syntax
06 Mar 2005 - Added fix for N_HDLC as a kernel-builtin (not a module) as reported on Xandros 3
