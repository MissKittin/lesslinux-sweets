SpeedTouchConf

Alcatel SpeedTouch USB Modem - Linux Configuration

This project is complementary to the SpeedTouch.SourceForge.Net project, but is
not directly related to it, and the SpeedTouchConf project should not be 
confused with the SpeedTouch project.
The documentation is available at SpeedTouch.SourceForge.Net but this script 
just does that lot for you, so you shouldn't need to bother reading 
documentation or understand anything about USB, PPP, or ADSL.

To use this script, you need:

   1. Save speedtouchconf-version.tar.gz, my script for configuring it all: 
      http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=68502
      This includes the speedtouch.sourceforge.net software.

   2. Untar the file: tar xzvf speedtouchconf-version.tar.gz
   If you are reading this README, you have already got this far.

   3. Get the Microcode from Alcatel (Thomson): 
          * Visit The Alcatel Microcode Download Page
	    http://www.speedtouchdsl.com/dvrreg_lx.htm
            (fill in your details, click "Continue" and select the "Binary" download link)
          * Or copy the alcaudsl.sys file from your working Windows installation

	          *** DO NOT INSTALL THE ALCATEL THOMSON SOFTWARE ***
                             *** DO NOT EVEN UNTAR IT ***

   4. Save the microcode (either speedmgmt.tar.gz, mgmt.o, *.ZIP, or alcaudsl.sys) 
      into the speedtouchconf/ directory. Only save ONE firmware file.

Then run the speedtouchconf.sh script *as root*
Answer the questions (VPI/VCI, login ID and password), and let the script do the rest.

You should be connected to the internet within about a minute or so.

If you want to automatically start the connection, the script gives instructions
about that, too.
